# highest_profit
a CSV file containing corporate profits over the years and create JSON format data and look for highest profit values in the data.
Challenge: highest-profit
The main.py is the where all the code is put togther
I have made seperate files incase one needs to be looked at further.
The code gathers data from a csv file and counts the rows within the file
and the it creates a new file with rows that show a positve profit
it also creates a json file where it is order in ascending order based on profit.
